<h2 style="text-align: center;">Project Guidelines</h2>

## Introduction

A big part of this course is for you to do a team project. 
This is your opportunity to take what you learned for a spin and try to get some insights to a real-world problem of your interest. 


## Team forming

- At the beginning of the semester, you will fill out a course survey in which you are asked to indicate your project topic interests (e.g., transportation, healthcare, environment, etc.)
- You will then be assigned to a multi-disciplinary team of three (3) with similar project topic interests (when possible). 
- After around the third week, check Canvas for your team assignment. 

## General requirements

- You are required to use Python (version 3+) and Jupyter Notebook for this project.
- You are free to include additional analysis or visualization using other software or languages that we do not cover in this course. 
However, they should only serve as supplementary components of your project.
- You are free to include data analysis, visualization, and modeling methods that we do not cover in the class.
- Do *not* modify the formats (e.g., font size, etc.) of the Overleaf templates. 
- To get graded, you need to submit the PDF files generated from Overleaf (see below) to the according Canvas assignments.


## Important deadlines

- **October 31 (Monday) at 6:11 PM**: Project proposal (team)
- **November 30 (Wednesday) at 6:11 PM**: Progress report (team)
- **December 12 (Monday) at 6:11 PM**
    - Video presentation (team)
    - Project poster (team)
    - Jupyter notebook and data (team)
- **December 13 (Tuesday) at 6:11 PM**
    - Peer evaluation form (individual)

## Project proposal (10% of project grade)

Your team will decide on our own project topic and find the data that you wish to use.
You are required to submit a project proposal, so we can make sure your selected topic and data set(s) are suitable for the project and you are on the right track.

Your project needs to be
- authentic (e.g., it comes from a *real-world* problem.)
- meaningful (i.e., the outcomes would provide values to others or are something you care deeply about.)
- reasonably complex (so that you can showcase a variety of things you learned from this course with reasonable depth.) 
As a rule of thumb, your project should be significantly more complex than the homework problems.
- feasible given the project timeline. 


### Proposal requirements
- **Proposal template**: You are required to use the proposal template on Overleaf (which will be provided to you later).
    - [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com/) is an online collaborative [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) editor for scientific writing. 
    - If you do not already have an Overleaf account, you will need to register for one. 
    The *free* plan is good enough.
    When register, use your UMICH email. 
    - Note we expect *all* team members to use Overleaf as a collaberative tool (think of a Google Docs) when drafting the proposal.
    - You will need to learn some basic LaTeX yourself and with your team using online resources. Here are two good starting points:
        - [The Overleaf LaTex Tutorials](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials)
        - [How to write a thesis using LaTeX full tutorial (YouTube video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqQM66uAig0) 
    - Note you just need a few basic things to get started.
    Learn more as you prepare for the proposal. 
    - Tips: *Recompile* often, so that if there is a compile error, it's easier to track it down. 


- The proposal should be no more than two (2) pages (not including the cover page and the References section). 
  It should include the following
    - **Project tentative title**
    - **Background**: A brief description of the background of the problem
    - **Research questions**: What do you want to figure out?
    - **Literature review**: What has been done by others regarding the research questions? Report on at least two (2) relevant scientific articles.
    - **Data set(s)**: Briefly describe the data set(s) you plan to use.
        Include the URLs to access the data. 
        Typically a single data set is sufficient for this project.
        It is recommended to use publicly-available data.
        See the Data Sources section below (near the bottom of this document) for starting places to look for data. 
    - **Method description**: what are the technical plans on how the research questions will be answered 
        (e.g., how you plan to analyze the data? what modeling work to conduct? 
        how to address the research questions based on the results?)
        Note I understand that we have not covered some of the modeling methods. See the [scheduled course topics](../) for more information. Describe your methods as best as you can.   
    - (Optional) A brief description of what you have done so far.

- You need to submit the PDF file generated from Overleaf to the according Canvas assignment.
- One submission per team.

Note if you plan to use regression models in your project, they are mostly suited for [cross-sectional data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_data)
(Think of the data sets we used in the lectures and homework.)
Cross-sectional data are what you should use for your project.
Do *not* use [time-series data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) (e.g., outdoor temperature by dates), as the independence assumption in regression models is likely violated (e.g., today's temperature is highly correlated with (thus not independent to) yesterday's temperature.) 

### Proposal grading rubric

Each component listed below will be graded. 
Under each component are the descriptions for three levels of "Excellent", "Good", and "Poor".

- **Background & data description**
    - Background and data clearly described
    - Background and data described but lacking clarity
    - Background and data not described

## Research poster (40% of project grade)

You are required to submit a research poster.

### Poster requirements
- **Poster template**: You are required to use the poster template on Overleaf (it will be provided by the instructor).
- See the template for all the required sections. 
- One submission per team.

### Things to keep in mind when working on the poster

Your poster should be different from your Jupyter notebook in some major ways:

- The audience of the poster is someone who have general knowledge about statistics and machine learning, 
    but may not necessarily know anything about Python, and they may not be familiar with the data sets you are using.
- Thus, your poster should not include any codes (leave them in the notebook). 
    Rather, describe things in plain English.
- You should also avoid using programing jargons (e.g., function names such as `groupby`), 
    or anything specific to the data set (e.g., column names such as "co2_level_mi").

### Poster rubric

- **Subject knowledge**
    - The poster demonstrated excellent knowledge of the course content and technical skills by integrating major and minor concepts and methods into the work. 
      The poster also demonstrated evidence of extensive research effort and a depth of thinking about the topic.

        Sentences were mostly grammatical and/or only a few spelling errors were present but they did not hinder the reader.
    - The poster lacked overall organization. 
        The reader had to make considerable effort to understand the underlying logic and flow of ideas. 
        Grammatical and spelling errors made it difficult for the reader to interpret the text in places.

## Jupyter notebook & data (20% of project grade)

You are required to submit all the jupyter notebook(s) and data used for the project. 

### Submission requirements

- You will submit a single ZIP file. 
    When I extract the file, the result should be a directory containing your Jupyter notebook(s) and all other files (e.g., data files). The bottom line is I should have all the files needed to reproduce all your results by running your code on my machine.
- Similar to the homework, before submission, make sure that *Kernel* --> *Restart and Run All* runs without errors.
- If your data files are large, it may take time to upload them to Canvas. 
    It is advised to submit the ZIP file at least one hours before the deadline, so you have some buffer time.
- If your data files are larger than 1 GB, contact the instructor at least two (2) academic calendar day before the deadline to arrange alternative ways to submit the data.

### Jupyter notebook rubric

- **Correctness**
    - The implementations of the methods in the codes were correct and appropriate.
    - The codes were mostly correct with some minor errors.
    - The codes contain major errors or were mostly not appropriate.
- **Research reproducibility**
    - Complete code, data, and other necessary files were provided so that the instructors are able to reproduce all your work. 
        The codes in the Jupyter notebook were well organized and easy to read. 
        An abundance of clear and informative Markdown cells as well as code comments were used to enhance the notebook's readability (see [Markdown for Jupyter notebooks cheatsheet](https://medium.com/ibm-data-science-experience/markdown-for-jupyter-notebooks-cheatsheet-386c05aeebed)).
    - Complete code, data, and other necessary files were provided so that the instructors are able to reproduce all your work. 
        The codes in the Jupyter notebook were somewhat easy to read. 
    A few Markdown cells and code comments were used with mostly clear information.
    - The submission did not include all files needed for the instructors to reproduce your work. 
        The codes in the Jupyter notebook were difficult to read or lack organization.
        Almost no Markdown cells or code comments were used to enhance the notebook's readability.

## Peer evaluation form (0% of project grade)

A peer evaluation form will be provided for you to evaluate your peer members in your team with structured questions. 
Your response will not be shared with any other students. 

*For each person in your team (other than yourself), indicate the extent to which you agree with each of the statements below, using a scale of 1-5 (1=strongly disagree; 2=disagree; 3=neutral; 4=agree; 5=strongly agree).*

- Attended group meetings regularly and contributed meaningfully to group discussions. 				
- Completed group tasks on time and in a quality manner.				
- Demonstrated a cooperative and supportive attitude.				
- Overall, this member contributed significantly to the project.

## Policies

### Honor Code

- Before working on your project, make sure to understand the general and project-specific Honor Code on what you are and are not allowed to do. 
    They can be found in the [course syllabus](../syllabus) in the Honor Code section.

### Lateness

- For *all* project submissions (the proposal, progress report, etc.), a late submission (within 24 hours) will receive an automatic 30% point deduction.
- Late submission for more than 24 hours will receive 0 points.
- The late penalties will by default apply to all team members and, in rare cases, may be adjusted at the instructor's discretion.

## Data sources

You can use any data sets of your interest. Below are some good starting places to look for data.
- <https://datasetsearch.research.google.com>
- <https://www.data.gov>
- <https://data.detroitmi.gov>
- <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php>
- <http://www.kaggle.com>
- Google search "open data portal" + some keywords of your interest.
[Click here](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22open+data+portal%22+bicycle) for an example.

## Practical advice

- If you are thinking about including this project to your résumé, keep this in mind from the start 
(e.g., when selecting the topic and data sets, preparing for the video). 
We recommend writing down a list of things that you would like to achieve at the end of the project, and working towards them intentionally while doing the project.
- Start early!
- Document as you go the things that you think you would want to include in the deliverables.
- Keep versions of things around: your Jupyter Notebook
    - Explains how you got there
    - In case you have to "go backwards"
    - In case you accidentally delete tons of work
- *Move fast and break things.* [Don't be afraid to make mistakes.](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/720257210161311744)
- *Stay focused and keep shipping.* Build a little, test a little.
- *Done is better than perfect.*

## FAQ

- Is it ok that my video is longer than 15 minutes?
    - See the Presentation Rubric --> "Presentation skills" above for details.
