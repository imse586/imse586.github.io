<h2 style="text-align: center;">Project Guidelines</h2>

## Introduction

Part of our course activities is for you to do a project. 
This is your opportunity to take what you learned in this class for a spin and try to get some insights to a real-world problem of your interest. 
You will decide on your own project topic and find the data that you want to use.

You need to identify research questions and select data set(s) that are meaningful, reasonably complex (so that you can showcase a variety of things that you've learned), and feasible given the project timeline. 
As a rule of thumb, your project should be significantly more complex than the homework problems and lecture examples.

## Requirements

- You are required to use Python and Jupyter Notebook for this project.
- You are free to include analysis or visualization using other software or languages that we do not cover in the class, however, they should only serve as supplementary components of your project.
- You are free to include data analysis, visualization, modeling methods that we do not cover in the class.

## Project proposal (10% of project grade)

- You are required to submit a project proposal (in PDF). 
The goal of the proposal is to make sure you select a topic and data set(s) that are suitable for the project and you are on the right track.
- The proposal should be no more than two pages. It should include the following
    - Project tentative title
    - Background: A brief description of the background of the problem
    - Research question(s): What do you want to figure out?
    - Literature review: What have been done by others? Report on at least two relevant references.
    - Data set(s): Briefly describe the data set(s) you plan to use.
        Include the URLs to access the data. 
        It is recommended to use publicly-available data.
    - Method description: what are the technical plans on how the research questions will be answered 
        (e.g., how you plan to analysis the data? what modeling work to conduct? 
        how to address the research questions based on the results?)
    - A brief description of what you have done so far.
- Your proposal may serve as part of your final report later on.
- If for any reason you are considering making major changes to your project topic and/or data sets after the proposal submission, consult with the instructor as early as possible.

### Proposal grading rubric

Each component listed below will be graded on a continuous scale. 
Under each component are the descriptions for three levels of "Excellent",
"Good", and "Poor".

- **Background & data description** (10 points)
    - Background and data clearly described
    - Background and data described but lacking clarity
    - Background and data not described
- **Research questions** (10 points)
    - Defined clear and meaningful research questions
    - Research questions are present but not articulated clearly
    - Did not define any research questions
- **Literature review** (10 points)
    - Identified more than two relevant work or extensive discussion of at least two
    - Identified and discussed at least two relevant works
    - Did not look into the literature
- **Methods description** (10 points)
    - Clear plan on how analysis and modeling would be used to answer research questions
    - Plan on how to answer question described but lacking clarity
    - No discussion of how analysis and modeling may be used to answer research questions
- **Composition** (10 points)
    - The proposal was clearly written, coherent, and well organized.
    - Writing and organization needs improvement
    - Not clear, coherent, or lacks overall organization.

## Project presentation (30% of project grade)

-   You are required to submit a video of you presenting your project.
    The video should be **under 10 minutes**.
    The video file should be in one of the following format: MP4 (preferred), MOV, WMV, and AVI.
-   The presentation should include all major parts of your project, with a focus on the results. 
    The following time allocation should be roughly followed.
    - 1 min: Introduction/background
    - 1 min: Research questions and the methods to answer them:
    - 1 min: Data description
    - 5 min: Data analysis, modeling, and results
    - 1 min: Discussions and conclusions
-   To record your presentation you are free to use whatever recording software that you are comfortable with. 
    If you are not familiar with the tools, we recommend the free and open source software [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com). 
    (All our lecture videos were recorded with it.) 
    It's fairly easy to use but do make sure to budget some time to learn the basics.

## Final report (60% of project grade)

You are required to submit a final project report, which should include the following sections.

- Project title
- Abstract (a self-contained, short summary of your work, 250 words or less)
- Introduction (e.g., background, motivations)
- Research questions
- Methods
    - A description of the data and access to the data (i.e., how one
        can gain access to the data)
    - A detailed description of your data treatment, analysis, and
        modeling workflow. Data treatment could include data cleaning,
        treating missing data, and other steps taken.
- Results (e.g., data visualization, model validations)
- Discussions (e.g., how the research questions were answered, any interesting insights, study limitations)
- Conclusions
- References
- Appendix (if needed)

### Things to keep in mind when writing the report

Your final report should be different from your Jupyter notebook in some major ways:

- The audience of the report is someone who have general knowledge about statistics and machine learning, 
    but may not necessarily know anything about Python, and they may not be familiar with the data sets you are using.
- Thus, your report should generally not include any codes (leave them in the notebook). 
    Rather, describe things in plain English.
- You should also avoid using programing jargons (e.g., "dataframe" or any function names such as `groupby`), 
    or anything specific to the data set (e.g., column names such as "co2_level_mi").

### Final report submission requirements

- You will submit a single ZIP file. 
    When I extract the file, the result should be a directory containing, at the minimum, your report (.PDF), Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb), and all other files (e.g., data files) that are needed to run you code.
- I should be able to reproduce all your results by running your code on my machine.
- Before submission, make sure that *Kernel* --> *Restart and Run All* runs without errors .
- If your data files are large, it may take time to upload them to Canvas. 
    It is advised to submit your report at least one hours before the deadline, so you have some buffer time.
- If your data files are larger than 1 GB, contact the instructor at least two (2) academic calendar day before the deadline to arrange alternative ways to submit the data.

### Final report rubric

This event will be advertised to our College and open to the public.
Your participation is encouraged.
However, you can opt-out the expo if you do not wish to have your project included for any reason and it will not affect your grade in any way.

## Practical advice

- If you are thinking about including this project to your résumé, keep this in mind from the start 
(e.g., when selecting the topic and data sets, preparing for the video). 
We recommend writing down a list of things that you would like to achieve at the end of the project, and working towards them intentionally while doing the project.
- Start early!
- Document as you go the things that you think you would want to include in the final report.
- Keep versions of things around: your Jupyter Notebook
    - Explains how you got there
    - In case you have to "go backwards"
    - In case you accidentally delete tons of work
- *Move fast and break things.* [Don't be afraid to make mistakes.](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/720257210161311744)
- *Stay focused and keep shipping.* Build a little, test a little.
- *Done is better than perfect.*

## FAQ

- Is it ok my video is longer than 10 minutes?
    - See the Presentation Rubric --> "Presentation skills" above for details.
- Are there format requirements for the final report?
    - No
- Are there requirements or limits on how many pages the final report should be?
    - No
- Why is it an individual project instead of a team project like in some of my other classes?
    - This is an introductory data science course and we want you to have an opportunity to practice *all* essential components and steps of an end-to-end data science project from data processing, visualization, exploratory data analysis, to modeling and reporting.
