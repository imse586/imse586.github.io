## Course description

Introduction to big data analytics and visualization. This course provides students with hands-on experience of using analytical and predictive modeling techniques and software for practical applications. Topics include data visualization principles and techniques, data processing and manipulation, and statistical learning methods such as linear regression, classification, model selection, clustering, principal components analysis, and time-series analysis.

## Course objectives 

At the completion of the course, students will be able to

- have a fundamental understanding of the tasks, methods, and challenges in data science
- learn programing fundamentals for data analytics and visualization
- obtain, explore, and transform big data from real-world applications
- learn common analytical and predictive models in machine learning
- use popular development environments (Python, Jupyter Notebook) in data science and machine learning

## Textbook

There is no textbook.

## Tools and technologies

Students will need access to a computer running Windows/Mac/Unix operating system.

Talk to the instructor if you only have access to a Chromebook or other systems. 

<h2><a id="homework">Homework</a></h2>

There will be roughly weekly homework (for a total of nine assignments). 

**Policies**

- All homework will be posted and submitted on Canvas.
- **Late homework will not be accepted** without valid documented excuse. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the documented excuse must be available to the instructor at least two (2) academic calendar days prior to the deadline.
Valid excuses include your own illness or injury, family emergencies, certain University-approved curricular and extra-curricular activities, and religious holidays. 
- It is highly recommended to submit early. You can submit unlimited number of times for each assignment. Only the latest submission will be graded. You are responsible for any last-minute technical or non-technical issues.  
- The excuses that will not be accepted include, but not limited to, 
  - missed the deadline by *any* amount of time
  - missed the deadline due to last-minute issues (e.g., network, computer)
  - submitted incomplete file(s) (e.g., missing the data files that are needed to run your code)
  - submitted a wrong file(s)
  - submitted to a wrong assignment

- Graded homework would be returned in typically two weeks. 
The solutions will also be posted on Canvas.
It is recommended to go through the solutions (even briefly) for your study purposes.
- **We will drop your one lowest homework grade when calculating the final grade.** 
An un-submitted work counts as zero.

**Format requirements**

## Reading assignments

There will be occasional reading assignments.
For each reading, you will submit a brief summary with your comments.

Some publicly-available readings are listed below in case you want to get a head start.

- [*Abraham Wald and the Missing Bullet Holes*](https://medium.com/@penguinpress/an-excerpt-from-how-not-to-be-wrong-by-jordan-ellenberg-664e708cfc3d) by Jordan Ellenberg
- [*The era of blind faith in big data must end*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2u_eHHzRto) by Cathy O'Neil
- [*How to Think about Data Visualization*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTingdk_pVM) by Jake VanderPlas

## Project

There will be an individual project in the second half of the semester.

See the [Project Guidelines](../project) for details. 


## Regrading policies

- Regrade requests for homework or an exam must be made within ten (10) academic calendar days of when the assignment is returned and must be submitted to the instructor in writing. 
- The entire problem, not just the disputed parts, may be reviewed. Thus, it is possible to receive a lower grade than before. 
- There will be no regrading for the final exam nor any grade changes after the final exam.

## Grading

| Item | Percent |
|:---:|:---:|
|Homework|45%|
|Reading assignments|5%|
|Project|50%|

The final grades may be curved as necessary.

Requests for improving grades based on individual needs will *never* be considered.

<h2 id="honor-code">Honor code</h2>

UM-Dearborn values academic honesty and integrity. 
Each student has a responsibility to understand, accept, and comply with the University's standards of academic conduct as set forth by the 
[**Academic Code of Conduct**](http://catalog.umd.umich.edu/academic-policies-campus/academic-code-of-conduct/), 
as well as policies established by the schools and colleges. 

Cheating, collusion, misconduct, fabrication, and plagiarism are considered serious offenses. Violations will not be tolerated and may result in penalties up to and including expulsion from the University.

**General course rules**

- All course work (i.e., homework, readings, project) must represent your own work.
- **Avoiding plagiarism**: You are not allowed to submit, as your own, work that is not the result of your own labor and thoughts. 
Work that includes material derived in any way from the efforts of another author, either by direct quotation or paraphrasing, should be fully and properly documented. 
To avoid plagiarism, you should cite all sources of both ideas and direct quotations, including those found on the internet. 
The citation should provide enough information so that the original source of the material can be located.
- If you have any questions about whether something is or is not allowed, ask the instructor *beforehand*.
- All violations will be penalized and reported to the Academic Integrity Board (AIB) at the University *with no exceptions*.

**Homework-specific rules**

- All homework are to be completed on your own. 
- You are allowed to consult with other students in the current class during the conceptualization of a problem. However, all written work, whether in scrap or final form, are to be generated by you working alone.
- In each homework, you are required to disclose any person that you have discussed the homework with.
- You are *not* allowed to discuss the problem set with anyone outside the current class. 
- You are *not* allowed to possess, look at, use, or in any way derive advantage from another student's work or the solutions prepared in prior semesters, whether the solutions were former students' work or copies of solutions that were made available by the instructors. 
- Once you have read this syllabus to completion, please use *confusion matrix* as the answer to the question in the first homework.
- You are *not* allowed to compare your solutions, whether in scrap paper or final form, to another student.
- **Penalty policy**: A single offense will result in 0 points for the involved homework *and* a reduction of one letter grade in the final course grade (e.g., from A- to B-). Multiple offenses in homework will result in a failing grade (E) for the course. 
If a student provided unauthorized help to other students, all parties will receive the same penalty.

**Project-specific rules**

- You are *not* allowed to receive any help on the project from another person other than the course instructor.
- The essence of all work that you submit for your project must be your own. 
You are allowed to use code snippets (defined as no more than a few lines of re-usable code) from the internet or elsewhere. 
However, the snippet must not constitute the core part of your work. 
And you need to properly cite the code snippets that you borrowed elsewhere.
- Work that includes material derived in any way from the efforts of another author, either by direct quotation or paraphrasing, should be fully and properly documented. 
To avoid plagiarism, you should cite all sources of both ideas and direct quotations, including those found on the internet. 
- You are not allowed to self-plagiarize, meaning that you can not submit your own previously produced work (e.g., from another course that you took or are currently taking).
- **Penalty policy**: An offense in an project will result in receiving a failing grade (E) for the course.

## Copyright policy
