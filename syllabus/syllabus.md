<!-- - [*Build a Career in Data Science*](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-career-in-data-science), Robinson & Nolis, Manning Publications, 2020 -->

## What <font color="red">tools & technologies</font> do I need?

You will need access to a computer that
- runs one of the following operating systems: Windows, MacOS, Unix
- has internet access
- has at least 2GB of hard drive space. 

## What are the <font color="red">homework</font> policies and formats?

There will be roughly weekly homework for a total of ten (10) homework assignments.
You can find the homework schedule on the [Course Calendar](../index.html#calendar).

**Homework policies**

- All homework will be posted and submitted on Canvas.
- **Late homework will not be accepted** without valid documented excuse. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the documented excuse must be available to the instructor at least two (2) academic calendar days prior to the deadline.
Valid excuses include your own illness or injury, family emergencies, certain University-approved curricular and extra-curricular activities, and religious holidays. 
- It is recommended to budget enough time for submission. You can submit unlimited number of times for an assignment. Only the latest submission will be graded. 
- The excuses that will not be accepted include, but not limited to, 
  - missed the deadline by *any amount of time*,
  - missed the deadline due to last-minute technical or non-technical issues (e.g., network, computer),
  - submitted incomplete file(s) (e.g., missing the data files that are needed to run your code),
  - submitted a wrong file(s),
  - submitted to a wrong assignment.
- **Homework without complete Honor Code signing will not be graded and get an automatic zero. No exceptions.**
- You should make sure your submitted work does not generate errors. 
  Before submission, you should click (on the JupyterLab menu) *Kernel* -> *Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...* to make sure it doesn’t generate errors. 
  Also remember to use **relative paths** when specifying file locations. 
  **Any parts of your homework that generate errors (e.g., due to failing to read in data) will receive zero points.**
- Your one (1) lowest homework grade will be dropped when calculating the final grade. No questions asked. An un-submitted work counts as a zero.
- Homework solutions will be posted on Canvas after the deadlines.
It is recommended to go through the solutions (even briefly) for your study purposes.

**Homework format requirements**

- Use the provided Jupyter notebook file as the starting point, and include all your code and answers in it.
- Show your answers to the questions clearly and explicitly. 
  You can use the Markdown cells to type in your answers. 
  You can also use the print function to show the answers. 
  The bottom line is we do not have to search for the answers buried in your code or output.
- You will submit a ZIP file called `imse586-hwX-yourUniqueName.zip`, where `X` is the number of the current homework. 
  For example, if I were to submit for homework 1, it would be called `imse586-hw1-rayanem.zip`.
- When we extract your compressed file, the result should be a directory called `imse586-hwX-yourUniqueName`, containing, at a minimum, a Jupyter notebook file called `imse586-hwX-yourUniqueName.ipynb` and all other files (e.g., data files) needed to run your notebook on our machine.
- In your submission, you need to include all necessary files (including data files, even if you didn’t make any changes to them), so that we can run your code off the bat. We will not supply any files or make any changes before running your code on our machine.


**Homework general suggestions**

- **Start early.** If you run into software or coding issues, it may take time to solve. It is best to find these problems early so we have time to help you.
- **Back up your work.** We recommend doing your work in a cloud file storage folder such as Dropbox (which is freely available for UM students).
- **Make your code more readable.**
  - Do not write all your code in a single cell or several large cells. Separate different parts of your code/answers in separate cells for better readability.
  - Use the Markdown cells to make your work more readable by briefly explaining what you are doing.
  - Additionally, use comments in the code cells to explain your code.
  - Follow naming conventions (e.g., `import pandas as pd`).
  - Use meaningful variable names.

**Homework regrading policies**

- Regrade requests for homework must be made within ten (10) academic calendar days of when the assignment is returned and must be submitted to <! --Dr. Feng --> Rayane in writing (email).
- The entire problem, not just the disputed parts, may be reviewed. Thus, it is possible to receive a lower grade than before.
- There will be no regrading nor any grade changes after the last week of class.
