**Format requirements**

See the top part of each provided homework Jupyter notebook for the format requirements.

## What are the <font color="red">Reading assignments</font>?

## What are the <font color="red">Honor Code</font> policies?

UM-Dearborn values academic honesty and integrity. 
Each student has a responsibility to understand, accept, and comply with the University's standards of academic conduct as set forth by the 
[**Academic Code of Conduct**](http://catalog.umd.umich.edu/academic-policies-campus/academic-code-of-conduct/), 
as well as policies established by the schools and colleges. 
Cheating, collusion, misconduct, fabrication, and plagiarism are considered serious offenses. Violations will not be tolerated and may result in penalties up to and including expulsion from the University.

**General course rules**

- All course work (e.g., assignments, project) must represent your own work.
- **Avoiding plagiarism**: You are not allowed to submit, as your own, work that is not the result of your own labor and thoughts. 
Work that includes material derived in any way from the efforts of another author, either by direct quotation or paraphrasing, should be fully and properly documented. 
To avoid plagiarism, you should cite all sources of both ideas and direct quotations, including those found on the internet. 
The citation should provide enough information so that the original source of the material can be located.
- If you have any questions about whether something is or is not allowed, ask the instructor *beforehand*.
- **All violations will be penalized and reported to the University's Academic Integrity Board (AIB) *with no exceptions*.**


**Homework & reading assignment rules**

- All assignments are to be completed on your own. 
- You are allowed to consult with other students in the current class during the conceptualization of a problem. However, all written work, whether in scrap or final form, are to be generated by you working alone.
- You are required to disclose any person that you have discussed the homework with.
- You are *not* allowed to possess, look at, use, or in any way derive advantage from another student's work or the solutions prepared in prior semesters, whether the solutions were former students' work or copies of solutions that were made available by the instructors. 
- You are *not* allowed to discuss an assignment with anyone outside the current class. 
- You are *not* allowed to compare your solutions, whether in scrap paper or final form, to another student.
- **Penalty policy**: 
  - A single offense will result in 0 points for the involved assignment *and* a reduction of three (3) letter grade levels in the final course grade (e.g., from A- to B-). 
  - Multiple offenses in assignments will result in a failing grade (E) for the course. 
  - If a student provided unauthorized help to other students, all parties will receive the same penalty.
  - Once you have read this syllabus to completion, use *severance* as the answer to the question in the first homework.

**Project rules**

- You are *not* allowed to receive any help on the project from another person other than the course instructor or GSI.
- The essence of all work that you submit for your project must be your own. 
You are allowed to use code snippets (defined as no more than a few lines of re-usable code) from the internet or elsewhere. 
However, the snippet must not constitute the core part of your work. 
And you need to properly cite the code snippets that you borrowed elsewhere.
- Work that includes material derived in any way from the efforts of another author, either by direct quotation or paraphrasing, should be fully and properly documented. 
To avoid plagiarism, you should cite all sources of both ideas and direct quotations, including those found on the internet. 
- You are not allowed to self-plagiarize, meaning that you can not submit your own previously produced work (e.g., from another course that you took or are currently taking).
- **Penalty policy**: An offense in an project may result in up to receiving a failing grade (E) for the course for all team members at the instructor's discretion. 

## What are the <font color="red">copyright</font> policies?

You shall not send, upload, or distribute any of the course materials to another person or on the internet. 
The course materials include, but not limited to, the lecture videos, Jupyter notebooks, and homework and the solutions.

## Food pantry

The pantry exists to support individuals on their journey as they work toward achieving their goals. We are committed to increasing access to food as a key to success, by assisting any student in need! If you need access or have questions, please contact the Office of Student Life by phone at 313-593-5390, by email at <umdearbornpantry@umich.edu>.
